# Ethernet

Ethernet Solves the collision domain problem by using a Technique known as carrier sense multiple access with the collision detection(CSMA/CD)

## CSMA/CD:

Used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data. 

## MAC Address (Media Access Control)

Its a 48bit number normally represented by six groups of two hexa decimal numbers. (2^48)

## Octet 

Any number that represents 8 bits. 

1. MAC Address is split into two sections 

2. First three octets of a MAC address is Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI)

3. Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one the transmission
   was intended for.

====================================================================

## Unicast

1. A Unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.

### Definition: 
A unicast transmission is intended for a single, specific recipient. Imagine sending a letter to a friend – it's addressed only to them.

### Example: 

When you visit a website, your computer sends a unicast request to the web server hosting that site. The server then sends a unicast response back to your computer.

## Multicast

### Definition: 
Multicast allows a single sender to efficiently transmit data to a specific group of devices that have expressed interest in receiving it. Think of it like a radio announcement – anyone tuned to that specific frequency can hear it.

### Example: 
Let's say you're streaming a live video conference. Multicast can be used to deliver the video stream to all participants simultaneously without overwhelming the network with multiple unicast streams.

MAC Addresses:

Unicast MAC Address Example: `00:0a:95:9d:68:16` (Every network interface has a unique unicast MAC address)

Multicast MAC Address Example: `01:00:5e:00:00:01` (Multicast MAC addresses have a specific range and format)

Broadcast: 

It's a third type of network transmission, and it's all about reaching everyone on the local network segment. 

Think of it like making a general announcement on a loudspeaker – everyone within earshot will hear it. 

Here's the key point:

Broadcast sends data to all devices on the same network segment.
In the context of Ethernet, a special broadcast MAC address `(FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)` is used to achieve this. When a device sends a frame with this destination MAC address, every single device on that network segment will receive and process it.

# Dissecting the Ether Frame work

## Ethernet frame:

1. A Highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order

A simplified framework of Ethernet framework

#### Preamble: 
 A "heads-up" signal to get ready for the package.
#### Destination & Source MAC Addresses: 
  Like the "to" and "from" addresses on your package.
#### EtherType Field: 
 Tells the receiver what's inside the package (like a gift tag).
#### Data Payload: 
 This is the actual content of the package – the message itself!
#### Frame Check Sequence: 
 A safety check to make sure the package arrived without damage.
