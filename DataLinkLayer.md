# Ethernet

Ethernet Solves the collision domain problem by using a Technique known as carrier sense multiple access with the collision detection(CSMA/CD)

## CSMA/CD:

Used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data. 

## MAC Address (Media Access Control)

Its a 48bit number normally represented by six groups of two hexa decimal numbers. (2^48)

## Octet 

Any number that represents 8 bits. 

1. MAC Address is split into two sections 

2. First three octets of a MAC address is Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI)

3. Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one the transmission
   was intended for.

## Unicast

A Unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
