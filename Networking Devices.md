Cables:
-> Conect different devices together allows data transmitted over them.
Two Types of cables:
1. Copper.
   -> Mostly we know that computer send the data using binaries (0 and 1). Receiver in the another differentiates the voltage difference with binaries 0 and 1 which can be translated into different forms of data.multiple ways.
   -> Most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking is cat(egory)5, cat5e, and cat6 cables.
   -> cat3, cat5, cat 5e, cat 6, cat 6a, cat 7.The twisted pairs inside the cable can drastically alter how quickly the data can be sent across them. How resistent the signals.

   Cross talk:
   -> When the electrical pulses are in one cable accidently detected in another cable causing the network error in the receiving end. Higher level protocols has a method for detecting the missing data and asking again
   the missed data. 
   
3. Fibre optics:
   -> Contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made our of glass about the width of a human hair.
   -> This tubes can transmit the pulses light to represent the 0's and 1's.
